# circosPlot
Circos plot of gene interactions using the effect size and individual haplotypes within each gene. 

This plot was generated using pycircos found here: https://github.com/ponnhide/pyCircos. 

# Outer ring
Genes with width set as the combined haplotype effect sizes

# Middle ring
Heatmap of the haplotype effect sizes within each gene (AA, BB, CC, AB,... etc)

# Inner circle
Weighted connections between the genes and subsequently the haplotypes within those genes
